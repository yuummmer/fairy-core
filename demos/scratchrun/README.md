# GEO scratchrun demo inputs

This folder contains small TSV inputs used by docs and golden examples for the `fairy preflight` workflow.

- `samples.tsv` — sample metadata (tab-separated)
- `files.tsv` — file manifest (tab-separated)

These files are referenced by:
- `docs/getting-started.md` (example commands)
- `scripts/update_goldens.py` (default inputs for golden updates)

Note: Keep the filenames and paths stable.
