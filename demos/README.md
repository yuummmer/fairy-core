# Demos

This folder contains small, runnable examples of FAIRy in action.

## Conventions

- Each demo should live in its own subfolder and include a `README.md` with a copy/paste command to run it.
- Demo inputs (CSV/TSV/etc.) should live alongside the demo.
- Demo outputs should go in a local `out/` folder inside the demo directory (and should not be committed).
- `_scratch/` is for ad-hoc files used during development. Treat it as non-canonical.

## What’s here

- `rulepacks/` — rulepacks referenced by docs for runnable examples.
- `params/` — example `--param-file` configurations referenced by docs.
- `_scratch/` — non-canonical scratch inputs (not a polished demo).
