# Demo parameter files (`--param-file`)

This folder contains example parameter files used with FAIRy’s `--param-file` option.

- `penguins.yml` is the minimal example referenced in the docs.
- See `docs/params.md` for usage and examples.

Note: Keep files in this folder stable, since docs and tutorials may link to them by path.
