# Contributing

Thanks for your interest! Until v1.0, we are not accepting external code contributions.
If you have ideas or bug reports, please open an issue.

> Note: We may introduce a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) later so we can offer dual/commercial licensing without chasing individual approvals.

## Specs & PRDs

Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) and design specifications are maintained in [`docs/prd/`](docs/prd/):

- **[Preflight Report Schema v1.0.0](docs/prd/prd-stabilize-json-report-schema.md)**: Stable JSON schema for `fairy preflight` reports

These documents serve as living "contract" documentation for downstream users and help new contributors understand design decisions.
