# Contributing

Thanks for your interest! Until v1.0, we are not accepting external code contributions.
If you have ideas or bug reports, please open an issue.

> Note: We may introduce a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) later so we can offer dual/commercial licensing without chasing individual approvals.
