# Maintainers & module stewards

FAIRy-core is currently maintained by:

- **Jennifer Slotnick** (@yuummmer) — project founder & lead maintainer

We’re actively looking for **module stewards** (maintainers-in-training) for
specific areas of the project, such as:

- Rule types and engine internals
- Rulepacks and repository-aligned checks (e.g. ENA, GEO, museum data)
- Tests and golden fixtures
- Documentation and examples

Module stewards help with:

- Triaging and clarifying issues in their area
- Reviewing or co-reviewing related pull requests
- Proposing and refining improvements in their area

If you’re interested, see the pinned issue “Call for module stewards / maintainers”
in the issue tracker.
